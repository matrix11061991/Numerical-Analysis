# Approximate calculation of areas by the trapezium method.
This method is very close to the method of rectangles but gives better approximations. To simplify the presentation, we will assume here that our functions are all positive on the interval on which we consider them.

Let's first define what is the area under the representative curve of a function on an interval [a,b]: It is quite simply the area between the representative curve, the abscissa axis and the lines *x = a* and *x = b*.

## Trapezoiddal rule
As its name suggests, this method of integration uses a sum of trapezium surfaces.
On each interval, we then perform the following approximation:
